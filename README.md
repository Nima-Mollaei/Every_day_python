# Every_day_python 🐍

Welcome to the **Every_day_python** repository!  
This project is a daily challenge where I solve one Python algorithm per day, with the goal of reaching a total of **100 algorithms**.

## 📂 Project Structure

- Each folder is named after the algorithm solved inside it.
- Each files name represents a specific day in the journey, titled as:
  
  > (1)a1z26
  > (2)accum
  > ...
  > (100)sudoku
  
- The explanation and code for each algorithm are provided in its respective Python file.

## 📌 Goal

- Practice and improve Python programming skills daily.
- Cover a wide variety of algorithmic challenges, including:
  - Sorting and searching
  - Recursion and backtracking
  - Graph algorithms
  - Dynamic programming
  - And more...

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Browse the folders to see different algorithm solutions.
2. Open any Python file to read the code and its inline explanation.
3. Clone the repo to try out the algorithms yourself!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Every_day_python.git
```

## 🧠 Why This Project?

Daily practice is a powerful way to build strong habits.  
This project keeps me accountable, consistent, and always learning.

## 📈 Progress

🎉 The challenge is complete!

- ✅ Algorithms solved: **100 / 100**
- 🏁 Final milestone achieved on: **[May 27, 2025]**
- 🧠 Daily commitment, consistent problem solving, and algorithmic growth.

> This repository now serves as a complete archive of solved Python algorithm exercises — ideal for reference, practice, or interviews!
